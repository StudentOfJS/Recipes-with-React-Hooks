      <h2>Creepy Halloween Cupcakes</h2>
      Ingredients Graham Cracker Crust: 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs 4
      tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter, melted 1/4 cup sugar Cupcakes: 2 cups
      all-purpose flour 2 cups sugar 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 2 teaspoons
      baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup
      buttermilk, at room temperature 1 cup warm water 1/2 cup vegetable oil 2
      large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Marshmallow Frosting: 8 large egg
      whites, at room temperature 2 cups sugar 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 2
      teaspoons vanilla extract For Decorating: 3 graham cracker sheets, broken
      into 24 pieces One 4-ounce bar semisweet chocolate, broken into 24 shards
      For the graham cracker crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two
      standard 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners. In a small bowl, stir
      together the graham cracker crumbs, butter and sugar until well combined.
      Press a heaping tablespoon of the crust mixture into the bottom of each
      muffin cup and bake until golden and just set, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside
      to cool. For the cupcakes: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour,
      sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add the
      buttermilk, water and oil and whisk to combine. Add the eggs and vanilla
      extract and whisk until smooth. Divide the batter among the muffin cups,
      filling them about two-thirds full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into
      the center comes out with a few crumbs attached, 12 to 15 minutes. Let
      cool in the tins on a wire rack for about 5 minutes, then remove the
      cupcakes from the tins and allow to cool completely. For the marshmallow
      frosting: Combine the egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar in a heatproof
      mixing bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk constantly until the
      sugar has dissolved and the egg whites are warm and smooth to the touch, 3
      to 5 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk
      attachment and beat on low speed, gradually increasing to medium and then
      finally up to high. Beat until stiff, glossy peaks form, 7 to 10 minutes.
      Turn the mixer to low and whisk in the vanilla. Spread the frosting on the
      cupcakes. With a handheld pastry torch, lightly brown the frosting.
      Decorate each cupcake with a graham cracker piece and a shard of
      chocolate.
